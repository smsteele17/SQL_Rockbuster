Here is a SQL query for common table extressions
This query is to find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country

WITH top_customer_count_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country, SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
AS (SELECT B.customer_id,
  B.first_name,
  B.last_name,
  D.city
  E.country
  SUM(A.amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
WHERE d.city IN ('Aurora', Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 'Kurashiki', 
                  'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY B.customer, B.first_name, B.last_name, D.city, E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5),
customer_count_cte AS (SELECT A.country,
  COUNT(DISTINCT D.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT A.country) AS top_customer_count
FROM country A
INNER JOIN city B ON A.country_id = B.country_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN customer D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
GROUP BY A.country)
SELECT A.country,
  COUNT(DISTINCT D.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT A.country) AS top_customer_count
FROM country A
INNER JOIN city B ON A.country_id = B.country_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN customer D ON C.address_id = D.address_id
LEFT JOIN top_customer_count_cte ON A.country = top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY A.country
ORDER BY all_customers DESC
LIMIT 5;
